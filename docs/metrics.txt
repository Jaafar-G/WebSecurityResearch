   Note: The data used as input was First Millionth ranking domains from
   Domcomp. The Public WWW, results  

    analysis.public_www_only.domains : These are the domains that are found from
    search keyword and only belongs to P3W and not found in Domcomp

    analysis.public_www_only.found_domains : These are the domains that are not
    common to the scraped sites but found in DomComp under 3 Mil or 10 Mil Data
    
    analysis.public_www_only.not_found_domains : These are the domains that are
    not common to the scraped sites and are not found in DomComp under 10 Mil
    
    Data analysis.public_www_only.total_found: Total number of found Domains
    that were not common to scraped sites but found from Public 3W
    
    analysis.public_www_only.total_found_above_3_and_under_10_mil: Domains that
    were not common and found between 3 Mil and 10 Mil Domain rank 
    
    analysis.public_www_only.total_found_under_3_mil : Domains that were not
    common and found under 3 Mil Domain rank 

    analysis.scraped_only: The Domains that were found in Domcomp but not in Public3W  

    analysis.total_common: Total number of common domains found in both Public3W and Domcomp  

    common: The common domains and their rank {'Doman': name.com, rank: 1} 

    Description: Data description public_www_domains: The result returned by Public 3W 
    after searching for tag 

    scraped_domains: The total domains and their found after scraping Domcomp data 

    search_tag: Tag used for searching the keyword in both Domcomp scraped data and 
    Public wwww


    Case I: 

    Ananlysis on analysis.public_www_only.not_found_domains  
    Tag search:
    function(_htas) Adnetwork: Hilltop 

    Public3W False Positive: 13/48 = 27.08%

    The false positive result includes those sites which are either unreacheable
    at momement or tag not present.

    Among the false positives sites: For some sites such as "desbie.com" and
    "nepaliputi.com" which were unreachable, was tracked snapshot back to Feb
    5th, 2015 for "desbie" and June 1st, 2007 for "nepaliputi" did not find any
    snapshot with search tag.  Similarly, sites such as "fbcinema.com" and
    "kinobas.net" had tag some time past. For fbcinema the last snapshot with
    search tag was found in March 20th, 2019 where as for "kinobas.net", it was
    not found in web archieve. 


    Case II: 

    Analysis on analysis.public_www_only.found_domains 
    Tag search:
    function(__htas) Adnetwork: Hilltop

    Public3W False Positive: 6/16, where 16 is only Public wwww found domains
    with tag but not common or in any DomComp data
 

    Case III: 

    Overall False Positive in Public WWW Data result: 

    Public3W False Positive: 6 + 13 / 67 = 19/67 = 28%, out of all Public WWWW 
    results returned of first 3 millionth ranks

    The sites in false positives are expired and unreachable domains.

    Case IV: Analysis on common

    The common domains rank does not match and differs with large distance in
    ranking
