Experiment Set up:
==================

AdNetwork Tested: 

    1) Admaven
    2) Adsterra
    3) Hilltop
    4) PopAds
    5) PopCash
    6) PopMyAds
    7) Propeller and 
    8) Revenue Hits

Plugins used: 
    1) Adblock
    2) Adblock Plus
    3) uBlock Origin
    4) Popup Blocker and 
    5) Ghostery

Browsers in-built adblocker used
    1) Brave and 
    2) Vivaldi

Platform Tested with respective to browser and plugins:
    1) Window 10 : Edge
    2) MacOS: Firefox, Chrome and Safari with plugins


Test run with fresh browser slate for each adnetwork
    For each run in browsers clean slate private mode was turned on and 
    tested different for each adnetwork.

Ads Type Analyzed:
    1) Static Banner with fixed length X x Y in the page 
    2) Popup banners that loads a banner when a page is loaded on the bottom 
    left part of the page
    3) Invisible (hidden) ads that triggers when text, link or any co-ordinate 
    of the ad page is clicked. 

The ads that we analyzed were intrustive kinds. 

Conclusions:

    1) Extensions inconsistency over browsers and platform on adblocking mechanism
    
    2) Safari extensions overall performance on blocking intrustive ads was
        overall poor compared to same extensions for firefox, chrome and Edge
    
    3) Out of 5 most downloaded plugins from browsers extensions: Ghostery 
        plugins was able to block 100% intrustive ads for firefox, chrome and Edge.
        For safari browser Ghostery plugin was not effective with efficiency of 2/8
        over adnetwork.
    
    4) Browsers such as Brave and Vivaldi which has inbuilt adblocking extensions
        were also analyzed. Brave blocked 5/8 adnetwork where as Vivaldi was 100% 
        ineffective in blocking any intrustive ads.  
    
    5) The plugins that we analyzed were effective to disable part #1 and part #2
        of the "Ads Type Analyzed" category. For #3, most of the plugins as shown in
        the table were not able to block. When user clicks on any text/link, the page 
        opened either tab under/ tab over/ popunders of intrusive ads. 
    
    6) Some adNetwork such as Adblock and Adblock were in "Acceptable Ads Program".
        When advertisers agree to ensure their ads meet certain criteria. This is where
        the adNetwork charge hefty price for large number of companies as part of white 
        listing client under acceptable ads criteria. 
        
        The critera for acceptable ads are:

        A) Are not annoying
        B) Do not disrupt or distor the page content while trying to read content
        C) Are effective without shouting at us
        D) Are transparent with us about being an ad
        E) Are appropriate to the site that we are on

        The adNetwork that we analyzed had an intrustive ads. The #3 category of 
        "Ads Type Analyzed" clearly violates being transparent and being an appropriate to 
        the site with techsupport scam, download software, notification etc. inorder to continue. 
        These were not only annoying but 
        also were disrupted. So, these ads clearly violated all the criteria 
        and both plugin were not able to block those ads.
