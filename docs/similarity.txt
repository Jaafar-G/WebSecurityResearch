    In this section we will be analyzing the following features.
        1) Code similarity among ad networks
        2) The similarity flow among different ad network, when ad is clicked
        3) Adblocker / Pop up Blocker analysis in Chrome in both incognito and 
            non-incognito browser experience

AdNetwork That Uses PopUnderJS (BetterJSCode) 

    => PopMyAds.com (css-tricks.html)
    => PopCash.Net (about-us.html)
    => HilltopAds (index.html)

    Note: Revenue Hits (js-tricks.html) : This script looks similar construction to popunder JS but is different. The idea of computing the initial set up was similar for least


Ad behaviour Same 
    => Revenue Hits and Asterra ads upon clicked redirected via "gotoapp8.com"
    => PopMyAds and Adsterra ads upon clicked redirected via "tracking.marketing" 

Plugin Used:

    I came to find Adblock Plus seems to have no effect over any of these code. Adblock Plus is one of the highest rated extension for blocking ads. 

    Since, we are more concerned with Popup blocker, added an extension named Popup blocker, one of the highest rated (https://poperblocker.com/) specific for pop up blocker. Poper Blocker is an extension to chrome which automatically removes all ad pop ups, pop unders, and overlays for a cleaner browsing experience. 

    1) Poper blocker : Blocking experience analysis on the basis of the browser mode for tab under

        NonIncognito:

            1) Hilltop (index.html) - blocked occasionally, plugin not consistent 
            2) Admaven  (events.html) - blocked occasionally, plugin not consistent 
            3) PopMyAds (css-tricks.html) - blocked occasionally, plugin not consistent 
            4) PopAds (html-tricks.html)
                    a) Overlay banner is produced
                    b) BUT Tab under is opened upon clicked
            5) Revenue hits (js-tricks.html) - Always blocked
            6) Adsterra (phani-vadrevu@site) - Always blocked

        Incognito:

            Popunders (Tab under) are created for following Ad networks.

            1) Adsterra (phani-vadrevu@site)
            2) Hilltop (index.html)
            3) PopMyAds (css-tricks.html) 
            4) Revenue hits (js-tricks.html)
            5) Admaven  (events.html)
            6) For PopAds (html-tricks.html) both tab under and pop under are created

        Note: PopCash (about-us.html) blocked for Nepal. Tried with Tor without adblocker and was able to produce tab under. 

    2) Poper blocker : Blocking experience analysis on the basis of the browser mode for overlay banner

        PopAds.net (html-tricks.com) has pop up overlay which upon clicked opens a new tab for chrome.

        Noticed different experience having pop up blocker for chrome.

        Incognito:
            Does not display over lay banner
            Opens a new tab ad upon clicked anywhere

        Non-incognito: 
            Opens over lay banner
            Opens both tab under and pop under 
            The feature POP UNDER is created which is not created in NEITHER incognito NOR any of the other Ad Network.

        Note: PopAds.net was the only Adnetwork that we analyzed for BANNER that had an overlay banner which created both tab under and pop under.
