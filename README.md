# WebSecurityResearch
Important Note:

The development of this web security research application was unexpectedly interrupted due to unforeseen cybersecurity challenges. While the work presented here is not in its finalized state, I believe in transparency and the value of shared knowledge. As such, I have decided to make this repository public. This allows others in the community to view, learn from, or even contribute to the ongoing efforts. I appreciate your understanding and welcome any constructive feedback or contributions.
